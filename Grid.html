Recent events have left many companies painfully aware of their inadequate planning for Disaster Recovery (DR). The old plan of relying on local backup to tape is simply not good enough.

Therefore, a libcurl based backup client that securely stores incremental, compressed backups on cloud storage services like Amazon S3 is essential so that data is safe no matter what happens to your home or business.
 </p>
<p class="txt-1"> Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive 
infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and 
to pass those benefits on to developers. </p>

The process of creating and managing duplicate versions of a data. 
Replication not only copies a data but also synchronizes a set of replicas so that changes 
made to one replica are reflected in all the others. The beauty of replication is that it enables many
 users to work with their own local copy of a data but have the data updated as if they were working 
 on a single, centralized data. For data applications where users are geographically widely distributed, 
 replication is often the most efficient method of database access.
